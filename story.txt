iTitle: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Reinaldo,

I am writing to you from a funny spaceship in a sweet galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in January. There are 18 apples and cards of boats here! In the
kitchen there is a pool full of coffee. I fall asleep each night on a full bed of
toys and dream of playing happily. It feels as though I have lived here for 15 fortnights.
I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is bird watching on a chill Honda Civic!!

Best wishes,
Reece
