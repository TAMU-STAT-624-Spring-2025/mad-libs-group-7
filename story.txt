Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Reinaldo,

I am writing to you from a funny spaceship in a sweet galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in January. There are 18 apples and cards of boats here! In the
kitchen there is a pool full of coffee. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
